Uav-Surveillance

Our project's main goal was to use DroneKit-SITL to build a Python script that autonomously pilots a drone along a predetermined course in disaster-simulated locations. With DroneKit-SITL, we set up a fictitious drone environment in which a quadcopter's flight from a predetermined GPS starting point within the fictitious disaster zone was simulated. High-level path commands could be sent to the virtual drone with ease because to the Python script we developed. Our project's main focus was on creating an advanced path-planning algorithm that directed the drone's movements without requiring manual definition of specific waypoints. The drone intelligently altered its course as it moved through the disaster region depending on the algorithm's inputs, enabling it to autonomously navigate and carry out surveillance activities including image capture.
